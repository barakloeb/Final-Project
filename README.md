# final-project
In this project we aimed to design a new Human-Drone Interaction by handing over and interaction device from the drone to a person.

We created a proof-of-concept with a DJI Tello drone that can be extended to larger drones in the future. The program includes Face Detection with opencv package and a tracking algorithm to center the drone in front of the person. In the end, the drone will hover above the person and land on his hand to simulate a handover of an interaction device from the drone to the person

The cascade folder contains different Haar cascade for different types of human detection
